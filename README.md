A Car Insurance Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI is a dynamic, interactive tool designed to help insurance companies and analysts monitor performance, uncover trends, and make data-driven decisions. It consolidates vast amounts of policy, claims, customer, and financial data into a single, visually engaging interface that supports strategic planning and operational efficiency.
At its core, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics such as total policies issued, premium revenue, claims filed, and customer retention. These metrics are typically displayed using KPI cards, line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, allowing users to quickly grasp the health of the business. For example, a line chart might show monthly growth in policy sales, while a donut chart breaks down policy types—such as third-party, comprehensive, or zero-depreciation—giving insight into customer preferences.
Claims analysis is a central component of the dashboard. It includes visuals that track the number of claims filed, their approval status, average claim amounts, and claim frequency by region or vehicle type. A map visualization can highlight geographic hotspots for accidents or fraudulent claims, helping insurers adjust underwriting strategies or deploy targeted interventions. Drill-through functionality allows users to explore individual claim details, including customer information, vehicle data, and claim resolution timelines.
